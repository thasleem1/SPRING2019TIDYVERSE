# Purrr

Let's say we have a dataset of alcohol consumption among countries and we want to find the mean consumption of beer, spirit, wine and pure alcohol. Dataset was retrieved from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/alcohol-consumption/README.md).

```{r}
alcohol <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv", sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = F)

```

<br/>

With base R we would type:

```{r}
beer <- mean(alcohol$beer_servings)
spirit <- mean(alcohol$spirit_servings)
wine <- mean(alcohol$wine_servings)
pure <- mean(alcohol$total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)

c(beer, spirit, wine, pure)

```


As you can see, writing code like this is not very efficient because it involves a lot of copy and pasting and can make possible errors. To solve this issue of minimizing repetition with further replication, we can use `purrr`. `purrr` enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. 

`purrr` allows you to *map* functions to data. 

+ map() makes a list.
+ map_lgl() makes a logical vector.
+ map_int() makes an integer vector.
+ map_dbl() makes a double vector.
+ map_chr() makes a character vector.

Appropriately the basic function in purrr is called map() and it transforms the input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input.

We can use this function to perform the same computations as above.

```{r}
map_dbl(alcohol[, c(2, 3, 4, 5)], mean)

```

<br/> 

Pipes can also be used...
```{r}
alcohol[, c(2, 3, 4, 5)] %>% map_dbl(mean)
```

# Stringr

This package is used to manipulate strings. For instance, if we want to gather the countries beginning with letter "S" using [regular expressions](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf) or [regexs](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285). Patterns in stringr are interpreted as regexs.

```{r}
unlist(str_extract_all(alcohol$country, "^S.+"))

```


Or count how many countries begining with "S"
```{r}
str_count(alcohol$country, "^S.+")

#Sum up
sum(str_count(alcohol$country, "^S.+"))

```

<br/>

Another is to convert the names of the columns to a title format instead of doing so individually
```{r}
#original 
names(alcohol)
kable(head(alcohol)) %>% kable_styling()

#to title
names(alcohol) <- str_to_title(names(alcohol), locale = "en")
names(alcohol)
kable(head(alcohol)) %>% kable_styling()
```

<br/>
