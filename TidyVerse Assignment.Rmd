I will focus on how to use the `Nest` and `Unnest` functions utilizing data from *FiveThirtyEight*,"How Popular Is Donald Trump?" from the trump-approval-ratings data set. <br/>

#Nest & Tibble {.tabset .tabset-fade}

`Nest` creates a list of data frames containing all the nested variables. <br/> 
(Source: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html)

`Tibble`, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don't change variable names or types, and don't do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. <br/>

## Nest Arguments

data - A data frame.

...  - A selection of columns. If empty, all variables are selected. You can supply bare variable names, select all variables between x and z with x:z, exclude y with -y. For more options, see the dplyr::select() documentation. See also the section on selection rules below.

.key - The name of the new column, as a string or symbol.

This argument is passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote strings and symbols). The name is captured from the expression with rlang::ensym() (note that this kind of interface where symbols do not represent actual objects is now discouraged in the tidyverse; we support it here for backward compatibility).

***

##Example

The first step is to load the data into R.
```{r message=FALSE, comment= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

```{r message=FALSE, comment= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
poll <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IsARam/Data607TidyVerse/master/approval_polllist%5B1%5D.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = "NA", strip.white = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
datatable(poll, extensions = 'Buttons', options = list(
  dom = 'Bfrtip',
  buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
  )
)
```

The next step is to use the `nest` function to create a list of data frames containing all the nested variables by pollster, in the below example. Use the `group_by` and `arrange` functions to achieve result. 

```{r message=FALSE, comment= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
npoll<-poll %>% group_by(pollster) %>% nest()
npoll2<- arrange(npoll, (pollster))
head(npoll2,10)
```

A `tibble` is displayed in the *data* column for each groupped *pollster*, sorted alphabetically in ascending order. 

***

#Unnest {.tabset .tabset-fade}

`Unnest` is the inverse operation of `nest`. If you have a list-column, this makes each element of the list its own row. unnest() can handle list-columns that contain atomic vectors, lists, or data frames (but not a mixture of the different types). <br/> 
(Source: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/unnest.html)

***

##Unnest Arguments

data - A data frame.

...  - Specification of columns to unnest. Use bare variable names or functions of variables. If omitted, defaults to all list-cols.

.drop - Should additional list columns be dropped? By default, unnest will drop them if unnesting the specified columns requires the rows to be duplicated.

.id - Data frame identifier - if supplied, will create a new column with name .id, giving a unique identifier. This is most useful if the list column is named.

.sep	- If non-NULL, the names of unnested data frame columns will combine the name of the original list-col with the names from nested data frame, separated by .sep.

.preserve - Optionally, list-columns to preserve in the output. These will be duplicated in the same way as atomic vectors. This has dplyr::select semantics so you can preserve multiple variables with .preserve = c(x, y) or .preserve = starts_with("list").

##Example

Using the nested table *npoll* from the example in the `Nest` section we can `Unnest` the table. This will display the orginal data table structure. The *pollster* column is now the first column and maintains the ascending alphabetically sort.
```{r message=FALSE, comment= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
unpoll<- npoll2 %>% unnest()
datatable(unpoll, extensions = 'Buttons', options = list(
  dom = 'Bfrtip',
  buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
  )
)
```
